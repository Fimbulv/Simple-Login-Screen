# Simple-Login-Screen
Basic login / sign-up screen using HTML / CSS without using Flexbox / Grid


The purpose of this small project was to familiarize myself with the basics of HTML and CSS without using Flexbox / Grid (my initial goal is to understand the basic methods first ie. margins / paddings, and how they interact with each other).Â 
A Few features include a sign-up screen that asks for name (first and last), DoB, email, password, and a few checkboxes to test out input types. Additionally, I also had a login screen that accepted an email and password but also had buttons to sign up using a Google / Github account (does nothing at the moment but will come back to it once I have the knowledge on how to implement). I also included a link to sign up if the user does not have an account.

I will be coming back to this as my experience and knowledge of HTML / CSS (as well as JS or other languages) expand.
